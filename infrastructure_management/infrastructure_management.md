# Infrastructure Management (IM)
First there was racking tens, if not hundreds, of pizza boxes in a communications room or DC. Then it become only ten pizza boxes as hypervisors became popular and started making virtualisation a thing. Now we're in Cloud land and everyone is web scale and fluffy.

With the Cloud upon us, containers containing everything these days, and virtualisation offering near bare metal performance, deploying infrastructure has never been so easy. Yet people still use web UIs and complex CLI commands to deploy their infrastructure these days. Let's move beyond that.

We're going to make our infrastructure code. We want it to be version controlled and smart. We want the tool that inteprets the code to be clever and automatically adjust our environment for us with a single, simple command. And just like our CM tool's code, we want it to be version controlled and human readable.

## Terraform
Hashicorp have done an amazing job over the past few years by introducing some amazing tools. Terraform is one of them, and it's amazing. I will introduce you to Terraform in the next section.
