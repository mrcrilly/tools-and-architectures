# Terraform Inventory
As we discuss on the [Terraform](../terraform/terraform.md) section of this guide, using the state database Terraform produces, we can provide Ansible with a dynamic inventory of systems to manage. This section discusses this project here.

## Ansible Inventory Terraform
The project name isn't very glam, but it's designed to be accurate, not attract the blank cheque of a VC. It does exactly what it says on the tin: it provides a dynamic inventory for Ansible against Terraform state.

The project can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/mrcrilly/ansible-inventory-terraform).
