# The Tools
Here are my tools of choice, in no particular order, roughly catergorised.

Please note that not everything has been documented yet. Anything that isn't a link is currently not available or unwritten.

## Configuration Management
* [Ansible](configuration_management/ansible/ansible.md);
* [ansible-inventory-terraform](configuration_management/ansible/terrform_inventory.md); Custom, dynamic inventory based on Terraform;

## Infrastructure Management
* [Packer](infrastructure_management/packer/packer.md);
* [Terraform](infrastructure_management/terraform/terraform.md);

## Continuous Integration/Deployment
* DroneCI;
* JenkinsCI;

## Monitoring
* Telegraf;
* Grafana;

## Database
* PostgreSQL;
* MariaDB with Galera;
* [InfluxDB](monitoring/influxdb/influxdb.md);

## Caching
* Redis;

## HTTPS and Load Balancing
* Nginx;
* HAProxy;
* Varnish Cache

## Logging
* ElasticSearch;
* Logstash;
* Kibana;

## Analytics
Undecided at this point. I'm currently torn between:

* Piwik;
* OWA;
* Google Analytics;

A decision will be made soon (and it will very likely not be Google's solution.)
