# Tools & Architectures
I've always wanted to document the tools and architecture I have so often used and implemented. I believe a lot of people miss out on very cool tools to work with and often poorly design and implement their networks.

The tools we use daily are really quite important to our jobs. The wrong tool, or the right tool misconfigured, can slow us down or result in data corruption or loss. We should select good tools, based on community input and reviews, and then use them correctly for the best results.

I've seen a lot of people implement poor networks with little to no monitoring, logging, security barriers, deployment processes, and much more. I want to help people design and implement good architectures by providing as much advise and tooling as possible, all wrapped with an example application.

Together, by pooling our knowledge and skillsets into this book, I believe we can help prevent the above and give new comers a fighting chance.

# This Book
This book is open-source and is intended to be shared in a non-commercial manner with everyone who is willing to give it the time. Please spread the word.

This book is also a place for me (and you) to continuously document the tools, processes, and architectures I deploy on a near daily basis. This book is intended to grow with time and collaboration. It will hopefully evolve as our industry shifts and morphs into something different from what it was only six months ago. If we can keep this book up to date with community driven best practices and advise, then we can help people implement better, more secure and resilient networks.

Hopefully we can capture those changes here and help people develop best practices for their business or project needs.
