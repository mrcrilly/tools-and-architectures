# My Fine Toolchain
Everyone needs tools to do their job, especially if you work in IT. I wanted to heavily document and outline how I use my favourite tools here, so you can perhaps learn something from my words.

What defines a tool in guide? Any piece of software, code, or documentation that helps solve a problem is a "tool." PostgreSQL is a tool that solves relational (and unstructured) data storage problems; MySQL and MariaDB do the same things. Terraform is an excellent tool for managing infrastructure as code, and Ansible is an excellent tool at configuring that infrastructure. Packer, combined with Ansible, helps Terraform do its job even faster. And so on.

This guide will include all kinds of tools used throughout my day to day. I hope my documentation helps you adopt the same tools and solve problems with them as I have done.

Feel free to comment and make suggestions.

## Tooling
Here are my tools of choice, in no particular order, but roughly catergorised:

### Configuration Management
* Ansible

### Infrastructure Management
* Packer
* Terraform

### Continuous Integration/Deployment
* DroneCI
* JenkinsCI

### Monitoring
* Telegraf
* Chronograf

### Database
* PostgreSQL
* ElasticSearch
* InfluxDB

### HTTPS and Load Balancing
* Nginx

### Logging
* Logstash
* Kibana

## Justification
None will be given at this point in time. Instead, I hope my documentation, examples, and labs will prove the tool's worth.
