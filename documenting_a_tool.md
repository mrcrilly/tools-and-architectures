# Documenting a Tool
Here we want to enforce rules for documenting a particular tool for use in our trade. These rules will establish a certain criteria for each and every tool that is considered to ensure:

* the tool is stable enough for production use;
* the tool's use cases are varied enough;
* there is a decent community around the tool;
* the code base is maintained;
* support, whether or not it is commercial, is available;

Perhaps I've missed something off of the list? Do let me know.

These rules also ensure the tool in question is documented to a minimum standard before being published in this guide. I would except all tools to have, at minimum:

* an architectural diagram explaining where it fits into a network;
* their installation well documented;
* an Ansible Role that installs the tool and manages its configuration;
* a DigitalOcean based Terraform solution for testing demonstrating the tool's use;

These rules aren't hard rules, of course, but sticking to them as closely as possible keeps documentation high quality and persistent.
