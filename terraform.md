# Terraform
Writing infrastructure as code is liberating. It's much faster and easier than clicking around web UIs or typing away at a CLI tool's options, and it's a superior to such options, too.

With Terraform, we will define our infrastructure's architecture in version controlled, plain text. We will be able to utilise all of Terraform's key features, such as being able to plan changes before executing them, managing multiple resources across mutliple cloud providers, etc.

## Documentation
Terraform's docs are good. They can [be found here.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html)
